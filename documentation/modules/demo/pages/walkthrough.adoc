= Demo Walkthrough

== Prereqs

See xref:demo:setup.adoc[setup].  Before attempting the walkthrough you should run this script:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
pass:[${DEMO_HOME}]/scripts/prepare-demo.sh
----

If the script ran successfully, you should see the following output:
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----

== Terminal Setup

For this demo VSCode is assumed.  Make sure you have 4 terminals all with a kubernetes context pointing to the namespace `operator-test`.  Click the tabs below to see information about each terminal and any initial commands that need to be run

[tabs,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
====	
Terminal 1::
+
--
Terminal one will be used for running local build commands and will be particularly important if showing a locally running build
--
Terminal 2::
+
--
Terminal 2 will be our CR watch window.  This is where we'll see updates to our CustomResource.

Run the following command to get it started:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
# watch updates every second with this command
watch -t -d -n 1 -x -- kubectl patch appops/my-bespoke-app -o yaml --type='json' -p='[{"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/managedFields" }, {"op": "remove", "path": "/metadata/annotations" } ]' --dry-run=client
----
--
Terminal 3::
+
--
The third terminal should be running the logs of the application (which will initially be more verbose than specified in the `AppOps` custom resource.

Run the following command to get this terminal ready:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
# start logging the demo app
stern demo-app --since=1s -n operator-test
----
--
Terminal 4::
+
--
The fourth terminal is used for issuing k8 commands
--
====

When you've finished, your terminals should look something like this (though the content will not be the same at this point)

[#demo1]
== Demo 1: Intro to the application

.  Make a call to the hello endpoint
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
curl pass:[${DEMO_OPERATOR_POD_URI_OVERRIDE}]/hello
----
+
[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
hello% 
----
+
. Next show terminal 3's logs and how its logging at a `INFO` level
+
. Show our app's AppOps in vscode by opening `appops-crd.yaml` quickly
+
. In the 4th terminal, show that the demo operator is running
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl get deploy/demo-operator
----
+
[.console-output]
----
NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
demo-operator   1/1     1            1           8m
----
. Explain that the watch window, terminal 2 is watching the CR we're about to create
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl apply -f pass:[${DEMO_HOME}]/demo/kube/myapp-cr.yaml
----
+
. Once the CR is applied, you should see the watch window change and the logging get less verbose
+

[#demo2]
== Demo 2: Show Operator Responding to Site Load

. Run the following command to increase load threshold
+
[tabs,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
====	
Terminal 4::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
hey -n 30 -c 30 -q 1 pass:[${DEMO_OPERATOR_POD_URI_OVERRIDE}]/hello
----
--
====
+
. You should then see the information in the CR change as well as the app's logging get more verbose:
+
image::cr-load.png[]

=== Other things to try

==== Edit the Custom Resource directly

. Edit the Custom Resource directly
+
[tabs]
====
Terminal 4::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl edit appops
----
--
====
. Change something like the `defaultLogThreshold` and save the edit
. Notice that the watch in *Terminal 2* updates and the logs of the pod in *Terminal 3* has changed accordingly

==== Increase the number of pods

. Run the following command to increase the number of pods
+
[tabs]
====
Terminal 4::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl patch deploy/demo-app --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/replicas", "value": 2 }]'
----
--
====
+
. Notice how the custom resource changes in *Terminal 2* as it should now show multiple pods

[#demo3]
== Demo3: Run the operator in the debugger to show how it works

To run this demo you will need to run some setup first

. First setup your environment accordingly
+
[tabs,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
====	
Terminal 1::
+
--
Make sure the following environment variables are set:

** `DEMO_OPERATOR_POD_URI_OVERRIDE=http://192.168.86.87:8008`
** `LOG_MODULE_TEST_INTEGRATION_URI=http://192.168.86.87:8008`
** `USER=<your quay.io user>`
** `PASSWORD=<your quay.io password>`
--
====
+
. Remove the operator from the cluster
+
[tabs,subs="attributes+,+macros"]	
====	
Terminal 4::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
kubectl delete deploy/demo-operator
----
--
====
+
. Run the following to start the app running locally
+
[tabs]
====
Terminal 1::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
cd pass:[${DEMO_HOME}]/demo/demo-operator
mvn quarkus:dev -Dsuspend
----
--
====
+
. the `-Dsuspend` means that the operator will not move on until you connect the debugger
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Before demonstrating in the debugger make sure:

* Number of pods is set to 0
* `DEMO_OPERATOR_POD_URI_OVERRIDE=http://192.168.86.87:8008`
====
